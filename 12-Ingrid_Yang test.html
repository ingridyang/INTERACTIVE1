  Popularity is not &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wrong <br> <br> in <br> and <br> of <br> itself, <br> <br> but it has its own perils. <br> <br> In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>doomed</strong> to failure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody gets upset when a <em>quiet</em> Brooklyn cafe with <strong>bad</strong>
  lattes <br> and <br> <strong>rude</strong> servers <br> goes out of business. <br> <br> But opinions are not the same as material <em>goods</em> or <em>services</em>. <br> <br> They won’t <strong>disappear</strong> if they are unpopular or even bad. <br> <br> <br> <br> In <em><strong>fact</em></strong>,
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; history has proven that most <strong>big</strong> ideas <br> <br> <br> <em>(and many bad ones)</em> <br> have been quite unpopular for a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;long &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time, and their
  <br> <br> marginal <br> <br> status has only <strong>strengthened</strong> them. <br> <br> <br> Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be <em>expressed</em> and recognized. <br> Today the Stream is digital media’s &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dominant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  form of <br> organizing <br> information.<br> <br> It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I <em><strong>gained</em></strong> my freedom, everywhere I turn <br> I <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; see <br><br><br> the <br><br><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stream. <br><br> I guess it won’t be too
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before we see news websites organize their <storng>entire</strong> content based on the same principles. <br> <br> The prominence <br> &nbsp; of <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the <br> &nbsp; Stream <br> <br> today
  doesn’t just make vast <br> chunks <br> <br> of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a <storng> deep betrayal </strong> to the diversity that the world wide web had originally <br> <br> <br> <em>envisioned</em>.
