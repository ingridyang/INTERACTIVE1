  <strong>Popularity</strong> is <strong><em>not</em></strong> wrong in and of itself, <strong>but</strong> it has its <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; own<br> perils. <br> <br> In a &nbsp; &nbsp;free&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-market economy, <br><br><br>low<br>
  <br> -quality goods with the wrong prices are <strong>doomed to failure.</strong> <br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody<br><br><br> gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes <br><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> of business. <strong>But</strong> opinions are not the <storng>s</strong>a<em>m</em><strong>e</strong> as material goods or services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad.
  In fact, history has proven that most <br><br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>big</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a l&nbsp; &nbsp;o &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;g time, and their marginal status has only <strong>strengthened</strong> them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be <em>expressed</em> and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>recognized.</strong>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stream <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; is <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;digital <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; media’s <br> <strong>dominant</strong> <br> form <br> of <br> organizing <br> information. <br> <br> It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I <strong><em>gained</strong></em> my freedom, everywhere I <br>t<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;u<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;r<br>n &nbsp; <br><br> I see the Stream.
  I guess it won’t be too l&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make <br> <strong>v&nbsp; a&nbsp; s&nbsp; t</strong> chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a deep <br>be<br>tra<br><br>yal
  <br> to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.
