  Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own
  perils. In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the
  wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a
  quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out
  of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or
  services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad.
  In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad
  ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their
  marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are
  radicalized when they can’t be expressed and recognized.
  Today the Stream is digital media’s dominant form of organizing
  information. It’s in every social network and mobile application.
  Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream.
  I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites
  organize their entire content based on the same principles.
  The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast
  chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also means
  a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web
  had originally envisioned.
