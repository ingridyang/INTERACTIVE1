  Popularity <br><br> is <br><br> not <br><br><br> <strong>wrong</strong> <br><br><br> in <br><br><br> and <br><br><br> of <br> <br> itself,
  <br><br><br><br> but it has its own perils. <br> <br> In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the w&nbsp; r&nbsp; &nbsp;o<strong>ng</strong> prices are <strong><em>doomed</strong></em> to failure.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gets upset when a <br> <br> <br> <em>quiet</em> <br> <br>
  <br> Brooklyn cafe with <strong>bad lattes and rude servers</strong> goes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; of business. <br> <br> But opinions are not the same as <strong>m</strong><em>a</em><strong>t</strong><strong>e</strong><em>r</em><strong>i</strong><em>a</em><strong>l</strong> goods or services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. <br> <br> <strong>In fact,</strong> history has proven that most <strong>big</strong> ideas (and many bad ones)
  have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their &nbsp;m&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be <em>expressed</em> and <strong>recognized.</strong>
  <br> Today the Stream is &nbsp; d&nbsp;i&nbsp;g&nbsp;i&nbsp;t&nbsp;a&nbsp;l &nbsp; media’s <strong>dominant</strong> form of organizing information. It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freedom, &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; everywhere I turn I see the <br> <em><strong>S<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;t<br>&nbsp;r<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e<br>&nbsp;a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;m.
  <br> <br> </strong></em>I guess it won’t be too l&nbsp; &nbsp;on&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; g before we see news websites <br>o<br>r<br>g<br>a<br>n<br>i<br>z<br>e <br> their <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entire
