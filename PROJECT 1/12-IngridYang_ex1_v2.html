  Popularity <br> is <br> not <br> <em>wrong</em> in and of <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; itself,
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>but</strong> it has its own perils. <br> In a free-market economy, <br> <br>
  low <br> <br> <br> -quality goods with the wrong <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prices <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <strong>doomed</strong> <br> <br> to failure. <br> <br> Nobody gets upset when a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>quiet</em> &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brooklyn cafe with <strong>bad</strong> lattes and <strong>rude</strong> servers goes out of business.
  But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won’t <br> <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; disappear <br> <br> <br> <br> if they are unpopular or even bad. <br> <br> In fact, history has proven that most <strong>big</strong> ideas
  <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (and many bad ones) <br> <br> have been quite unpopular for a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; time, and their &nbsp; &nbsp; marginal &nbsp; &nbsp; status has only <strong>strengthened
  </strong> them. <br> <br> Minority<br> <br> <br> views are <strong>ra</strong>di<strong>cal</strong>ized when they can’t be <em>expressed</em> and
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>recognized.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> <br> Today the Stream
  is &nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp;i&nbsp;g&nbsp;i&nbsp;t&nbsp;a&nbsp;l &nbsp; media’s <br> <br> dominant <br> <br> form of <br> o<br>r<br>g<br>a<br>n<br>i<br>
  z<br>i<br>n<br>g  information. It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the <br> <br>
  S<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;t<br>&nbsp; r<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;e<br>&nbsp; a<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;m. <br> <br>I guess it won’t be too l&nbsp; &nbsp; o&nbsp; &nbsp;
  n&nbsp; &nbsp;g before we see news websites <br>organize<br> their entire <br> content based <br> on the same principles. <br><br> The prominence
  of the Stream today doesn’t just make <storng>vast</strong> c&nbsp; &nbsp;hu&nbsp; &nbsp;nk&nbsp; &nbsp;s of the Internet biased against quality — 
  it also means a <strong>deep</strong> betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.
