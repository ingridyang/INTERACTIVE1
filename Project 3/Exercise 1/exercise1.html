      PART 1 <BR><BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’ve always been curious about the algorithm that social networks or other big companies use to market specific advertisement for their users. Personally, I have experienced that situation using Instagram; for example, I was online shopping at Abercrombie and a couple hours or days later I get an ad on Abercrombie. It gives me the heebie jeebies that Instagram has a way to promote specific ads that I have searched previously or even talked about. It leads me to think the app is able to hear what I say so it can give me ads that I would want to go look at.
      In Your Phone Company is Watching it touches upon that topic of how these platforms track what users do. How the phone company Spits uses, refuses to give him the tracking information the phone company keeps. Spits had to pull out the law talk to get the phone company to finally give him HIS own information. It striked me that the phone company would not give Spits information that pertains to him, it gave me really bad impression and made me feel uncomfortable about what these companies could be hiding.
      Another article, This is Exactly How Social Media Algorithms Work Today, explains the algorithm of different social platforms, how they determine what should be on the top page based on certain profiles that were looked at, interactions pages or people, etc. It seemed like a harmless algorithm, but the more I thought about it, it seemed a bit creepy. How these platform are able to record millions and billions of users in order to improve usability.

      PART 2 <BR><BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After looking at Your Phone Company is Watching and further research on platforms tracking users content, I started to wonder if there would be a more public and friendly way of promoting advertisement for users.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the speaker, Malte Spits, concluded his talk he said, “So in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, have it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age”, it brought up a good point of boundaries in using social platforms or any digital platform. Having an unsure feeling of whether platforms are tracking every tap can feel uncomfortable, so I propose a user-friendly interactive web page that allows users to pick and choose what advertisement interests them and each time it refreshes, it shows different ads. In other words, it is an advertisement web page.
	Another proposal is a web page that allows users log in to their account in order to see every interaction they have done on specific platforms. Essentially it is a web page that helps users see what they are being tracked on so they won’t feel uncomfortable about what they are being recorded on. Everytime the web page refreshes it updates the users, so it is a live web page that doesn’t stop updating.
